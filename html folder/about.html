        <li>Germination: Mango seeds are planted in nutrient-rich soil and watered regularly. The seedling emerges from the soil within a few weeks.</li>

       <li> Seedling stage:The mango seedling grows into a small tree with a single stem and a few leaves. During this stage, the tree requires regular watering and fertilization.</li>

         <li>Vetetative growth:The tree grows rapidly and produces many branches and leaves. This stage can last for several years, during which time the tree does not produce fruits.</li>

         <li>Flowering stage:The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The flowers typically appear in the late winter or early springs.</li>

         <li>Fruit development Stage:After flowers are pollinated, small green fruits appear on the tree. Over a time fruits become ripened and ready for harvesting.</li>

         <li>Harvesting stage:Fruits are typically harvested when they are fully ripe and have developed their characteristic color and aroma. This stage lasts for several days.</li>

         <li>Dormancy stage: After the mangoes have been harvested, the tree enters a period of dormancy during which it conserves its energy and prepares for the next growing season.</li>
